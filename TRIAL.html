<H3 style="font-size:30px">JAI  SRI RAM</H3><br>
<P><b>Today, when Indian Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi  laid the foundation stone for a grand temple at Ayodhya , the 500 year old cultural conflict ended and the heritage restored in its finest form. 
Here we are not going to discuss any political angles we will just look into the history of the “RAM JANAM BHUMI “.</b></P><br>
<H4 style="font-size:30px">1-> Who was Lord Rama ?</H4><br>
<p align="center"><img src="whorama.GIF" height="300" alt="LEGEND" ></p><br>

<P><b>Yes, I know that you know it far better than me but just in case if you are “sonakshi sinha”  fan  or have an IQ level equal to my ex , “let me tell you that Lord Rama also known as Ramachandra (रामचन्द्र, Rāmacandra), is a major deity of Hinduism. He is 7th avatar of the God Vishnu, one of his most popular incarnations along with Krishna, Parshurama, and Gautama Buddha. ... Rama was born to Kaushalya and Dasharatha in Ayodhya, the ruler of the Kingdom of Kosala. He is worshipped in the form of qualities that are rare in humans , he is the synonym of human qualities at the perfect level. & Not amount of  Words are not enough to define his highness. ”</b></P><br>
<H5 style="font-size:30px">2-> What was conflict ?</H5><br>
<P><b>I know you know it too but lets discuss it step by step
Shri rama janmabhumi  teerth kshetra  dispute or AYODHYA DISPUTE started back in 1528 when a general of Babur(Mughal emperor) named “Mir Baqi” captured ayodhya and demolished the Rama temple and built Babri mosque there. ( it is believed theory , some people also believe that Aurangzeb demolished the temple , as there are no literature and text available for reference between  the  era 1658-1707 AD).
So the matter came into light when a Surveyor from East India  Company named “Francis Buchanan” where he found the facts that Aurangzeb demolished the temple and built mosque in 1690-95. “The spark of communal violence started since then” and in1946  HINDU MAHASABHA  activists broke into the mosque and placed idols of Rama and sita . People were led to believe that the idols had “miraculously ” appeared inside the mosque.
After Independence  JN nehruji insisted that the idols should be removed from mosque  however the local officials refused to do so. Which turned the mosque into  “De facto temple”. Both sides the sunni wakf board and and Akhil Bhartiya ramayan mahasabha  filed suits in a local courts staking their respective claims to the sites and the most infamous dispute took its shape.<b></P><br>
<H5 style="font-size:30px">3-> When things went out of control?</H5>
<br>
<P><b>In 1990 the Rath-yatra started by Mr LK advani  through which he generated a movement where he made hindus believe that “If muslims are entitled to an Islamic atmosphere in Mecca and Christians are entitled to a Christian atmosphere in Vatican why is it wrong for the Hindus to expect Hindu atmosphere in Ayodhya”.   The rathyatra turned out to be the foundation stone for communal violence amongst the two communities. 
On 6th December 1992,more than  150,000 VHP & BJP karsevaks from allover India reached Mosque and demolished it. Riots broke all over India , thousands of people were killed in these riots. The series of riots kept on breaking until  “9th November 2019” when Supreme court ordered the land to be handed to trust to build temple & ordered the government to give an alternate 5acre land to the sunni wakf board for the purpose of building  a mosque.</b>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>So that’s it we covered whole issue in just 3 questions and less than 550 words .
